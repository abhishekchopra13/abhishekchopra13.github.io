Hey!

I'm a Quant Researcher at [514 Capital](https://514capital.com), working on systematic macro trading strategies. Previously I used to work at [Squarepoint Capital](https://www.squarepoint-capital.com/) focussing on FX & Crypto. Prior to my professional life I spent 4 years at the [Indian Institute of Technology, Patna](https://www.iitp.ac.in/departments/engineering-technology/computer-science-and-engineering), earning my Bachelor's in Computer Science from 2018 to 2022. During my undergrad I did a lot of [algorithmic competetions](https://clist.by/coder/darklight13/) and in the residual time I tried meeting my assigment deadlines and spent a lot of time with my friends <3.

I travel frequently in between Chandigarh, Dubai, London and Bangalore. If you would like to catchup for coffee or chat feel free to ping me on [X](https://x.com/abhiii_13) or abhishekchopra13@hotmail.com.
