Hey!

I’m a Quantitative Analyst at [Squarepoint Capital](https://www.squarepoint-capital.com/), where I dive deep into the fascinating world of systematic macro trading strategies. Originally from the vibrant city of [Chandigarh, India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandigarh), I am currently residing in London, where I continue to explore the dynamic intersections of finance and technology.


Before embarking on this thrilling journey, I spent four unforgettable years at the [Indian Institute of Technology, Patna](https://www.iitp.ac.in/departments/engineering-technology/computer-science-and-engineering), earning my Bachelor's in Computer Science from 2018 to 2022. Those years were nothing short of a rollercoaster ride filled with late-night coding marathons and caffeine-fueled study sessions—definitely the best four years of my life!

During my undergrad, I immersed myself in [competitive programming](https://clist.by/coder/darklight13/) and explored a plethora of mathematics and finance courses, all while trying to figure out how to balance it with acads. Nowadays, I find myself delving into the world of statistics, currently engrossed in the pages of [ESLP](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Elements-Statistical-Learning-Springer-Statistics/dp/0387848576). When I’m not crunching numbers or analyzing market trends, you can find me (mostly) socializing with friends, either watching or playing football, or battling it out on my Xbox (Overwatch 2, FIFA).
